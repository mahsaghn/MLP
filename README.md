# MNIST Noise Removal
This project contains two separate phases. First, implement k fold cross validation; second, remove the noise of handwritten digit by use of MLP.

## Phase1: CrossValidation
I Used MNIST dataset inorder to implement **kfold cross validation** to classify handwritten English numbers.

## Phase2: Noise Removal:
In this phase, various levels of noise are added into MNIst dataset. 
Noise added in dataset: 
- Gaussian
- S and P
